The following 10 data points were obtained by hovering over the blue dots on the graph:

The following 10 data points were obtained by hovering over the blue dots on the graph:
Point	X Value	Y Value
| Point | X Value | Y Value |
|:------|:--------|:--------|
| 1     | -9.00   | 7.90    |
| 2     | -7.06   | 6.65    |
| 3     | -5.00   | 5.00    |
| 4     | -3.03   | 2.70    |
| 5     | -1.03   | 1.14    |
| 6     | 1.00    | -0.62   |
| 7     | 3.00    | -3.18   |
| 8     | 5.03    | -4.58   |
| 9     | 7.97    | -6.78   |
| 10    | 9.26    | -8.06   |



Pearson Correlation Calculation

Formula Used:

              ∑(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ)
r = ────────────────────────────────
    √[∑(xᵢ - x̄)² * ∑(yᵢ - ȳ)²]

Results:

Pearson correlation coefficient (r): -0.998552

Coefficient of determination (r²): 0.997106

Percentage of variance explained: 99.71%

Interpretation
Strength: VERY STRONG Correlation (Almost Perfect!)
The variables show an almost perfect linear relationship

r² = 0.9971 means 99.71% of Y's variation is explained by X

This is an exceptionally strong correlation

Direction: NEGATIVE Correlation
As X increases, Y tends to decrease

This indicates an inverse relationship between X and Y

Regression equation: y = -0.8966x + 0.1192
